    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p class="plot"> </p>
    <p>The film's story revolves around two individuals: a Hawaiian girl named Lilo 
      Pelekai, who is raised by her older sister Nani after their parents' deaths, 
      and a extraterrestrial creature called Experiment 626, who is adopted by Lilo 
      as her "dog" and renamed "Stitch". Stitch, who was genetically engineered to 
      cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid recapture by the 
      intergalactic federation after him, but they develop a close bond through the 
      Hawaiian concept of Ê»ohana, or extended family, causing Stitch to reconsider 
      his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his newfound family together.</p>
